# What is artificial intelligence (AI)?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is software that exhibits one or more human-like capacities.

- Visual perception - The ability to use computer vision capabilities to accept, interpret, and process input from images, video streams, and live cameras.
- Text analysis and conversation - The ability to use natural language processing (NLP) to not only "read", but also generate realistic responses and extract semantic meaning from text.
- Speech - The ability to recognize speech as input and synthesize spoken output. The combination of speech capabilities together with the ability to apply NLP analysis of text enables a form of human-compute interaction that's become known as conversational AI, in which users can interact with AI agents (usually referred to as bots) in much the same way they would with another human.
-	Decision making - The ability to use past experience and learned correlations to assess situations and take appropriate actions. For example, recognizing anomalies in sensor readings and taking automated action to prevent failure or system damage.

Usually we use machine learning algorithms to create AI software.
