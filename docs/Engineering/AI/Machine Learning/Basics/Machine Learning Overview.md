# What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Practically, we are at the stage that we gives data for a algorithm to learn from and we test its performance by a measurement of measure.

For example, a spam filter is a Machine Learning problem that can learn to flag spam given examples of spam emails and identify regular emails. The data that's used to learn is called *training set*, each training example in the training set is called a *training instance* or simply *sample*. In case of classification task, we may use *accuracy* to measure how correct it classified a spam email.

Benefit of using machine learning algorithms instead of regular algorithms is that we do not need to specify the rules for a task explcitly. We just need to feed datas to the machine learning algorithm. Any unnoticed rules that should specify for regular algorithms can be omitted by machine learning algorithms due to the fact that machine learning algorithms are rules independent but data dependent. Any flutuations from the environment will be observed by the machine learning algorithm.
# Classification of Machine Learning tasks.

In General, we can classify a machine learning system by the following:
1. The necessacity of a human assistant. (Supervised learning, unsupervised, semisupervised, reinforcement)
2. The ability to learn to learn continuous and quickly. (Online, Batch)
3. The ways they generalized the observations (Instance-based, model-based)
