# What is Lean?

The [Lean theorem prover](https://lean-lang.org/) is a proof assistant developed principally by Leonardo de Moura.

# Mathlib
The Lean mathematical library, [mathlib](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib-overview.html), is a community-driven effort to build a unified library of mathematics formalized in the Lean proof assistant. The library also contains definitions useful for programming. This project is very active, with many regular contributors and daily activity.

# What is a proof assistant?

A proof assistant is a software that provides a language for defining objects, specifying properties of these objects, and proving that these specifications hold. The system checks that these proofs are correct down to their logical foundation.

In short, it checks the validity of your proof.
